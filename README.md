# Deliverables
- Develop a Bash script that performs a network port scan.
- You need to ask the user for input values and check the status of specific ports on a target domain.
- The script must display the port status (open, closed, or filtered) with appropriate messages and color-coded output.
- The script should use nc (netcat) or nmap to check the status of the specified ports.
- You must handle error checking for input values and accept query parameters to display help or version information.
- You should accept only valid input formats (e.g., domain names should be alphanumeric, port values should be numeric).
- If the script encounters an issue connecting to the target host, it should inform the user.
- A user can either enter a domain name or an IP address with their options.
- Do not forget to include proper commenting and structure.
- Your script should support
```
 --help or -h: Display help information.
 --version or -v: Display version information.
```
- Use color-coding for port statuses:
```
Green for open.
Red for closed.
Yellow for filtered.
```
